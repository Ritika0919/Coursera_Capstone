# Coursera_Capstone
I have been taking the Data Science Professional Certificate Course, of rth last few months. It is  a 9 part, introductory course for those of us who are intrigued by Data Science but don't know much about how to handle large datasets. 
This is the repository for the Capstone projects in the Coursera Professional Data Science Certificate, which is the 9th course in the professional certificate program.
