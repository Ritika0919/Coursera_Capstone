# Battle of the Neighborhoods: Examining the Diversity in Cuisines from the East to the West of Toronto

##     1. Introduction:

##### _According to the article in https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/california/articles/the-10-most-multicultural-cities-in-the-world/, Toronto is one of the most international cities in the world. With millions of people migrating to Canada annually, it's cultural diversity has been enriched over the years, as have the food habits of the country._ 

##### _For my Capstone Project, I have chosen to explore the variance in cuisines of two different boroughs of Toronto, to truly fathom the impact of immigration on Canada's gastronomic diversity._

##### _As we will see later in the project, the Folium map of the Toronto neighborhoods shows us that, the neighborhoods are spread out in a roughly rectangular shape. There is a greater probability of variety in cuisines of the neighborhoods in the East-West direction there is in the North-South direction. Therefore, I have chosen to explore  Scarborough (a borough from the East of Toronto) and Etobicoke (a borough from the West of Toronto), to understand the true diversity in cuisines of Toronto as a result of immigration._
